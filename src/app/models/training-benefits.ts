    content: `One of the primary reasons that someone should have a Personal Trainer is that they are trained in teaching others how to exercise. And while exercise in itself is only a part of fitness, with nutrition and lifestyle playing an essential role in the overall picture if you don’t get exercise right then you will never achieve your goals.`,

    title: 'Proper Form',

    content:
      'Having a Personal Trainer beside you to demonstrate the correct posture and technique is invaluable. A Personal Trainer will ensure clients are performing exercises correctly and efficiently, in order to maximise results. If your form when exercising is not correct, then you are at increased risk of injury as well as not achieving your goals (because nothing kills a dream like 10 weeks of prescribed bed rest!).',

    title: 'Cleanliness',

    content: `With everything going on the world these days, you really want to limit your exposure. We understand, so at the Expert Fitness Gym you can trust that we are staying on top of maintaining the highest level of cleanliness. Not only do we sanitize the facility and equipment before every session; we also keep you informed should we observe anyone that shows any signs of being sick. We will contact you before your session should we observe anyone come in contact with any part of our gym or that in any way leads us to have concerns. We are taking every reasonable measure to ensure your health and safety, and we also want to have a an exceptionally clean working environment for the sake of our own families and friends.`,

    title: 'Unique Requirements',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-open-gym.jpg',
    content: `Everybody is different, and that means everyone’s abilities and requirements are different when it comes to exercise. This could be anything from having an old injury that requires special exercises to having a phobia that may impact on where or how you workout.

  For example, if you have an old knee injury that required surgery, but since then you haven’t done anything to rebuild the muscles or improve mobility, then you are going to need different exercises and goals than an athlete who is training to run a marathon. This is where a Personal Trainers experience can make a huge difference to your training program.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Realistic Goals',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-huge-freeweights.jpg',
    content: `Everyone wants to achieve their goals straight away, whether they be weight loss, cheese grater abs or Hulk-like strength. But these are not always achievable, and if you don’t hit them then you may be discouraged and backslide.

  A Personal Trainer will not only help you set realistic goals that you will be able to achieve - if you put in the effort, of course - but they will also be able to keep you on track to hit those goals. For example, if your goal is to achieve a ‘bikini body’ for summer, it’s not just about doing 100 crunches a day for a month to work your abs. It’s about altering your diet to eat the correct foods, mixing cardio and weights to work the right muscles, and setting a timeframe in which this can be achieved.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Specific Goals',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-huge-dumbells.jpg',
    content: `As well as helping their clients set realistic goals, Personal Trainers are the perfect tool to help you achieve a specific goal. This is ideal for those who are training for a specific event, or need to achieve a certain level of fitness before they are able to do something they really want.

  For example, if you have a bucket list with ‘Skydiving’ on it but are over the maximum weight, then hiring a Personal Trainer to assist with helping you lose weight is a great start to achieving this goal. Or if your goal is to be able to run a marathon in six months, then hiring a Personal Trainer to put you on the right track could be all you need to complete a marathon.`,

    title: 'Accountability',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `How many times have you gone to bed and said to yourself, ‘Tomorrow I’m going to wake up, go to the gym, and do an hour workout before I get ready for work’, and then woken up and decided to sleep for another hour instead of exercising?

  This is where a Personal Trainer is critical to ensuring that you commit and stick to your fitness goals. If you’ve made an appointment to meet you trainer for a session, then you are far more likely to still go than if you are just telling yourself you should go to the gym.`,

  {
    title: 'Efficiency',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `We can all get in a good workout, but are you working our just for the fun of it? Of course not, you have fitness goals, and trainers are already set with the right kinds of training in mind for guiding you towards achieving those goals at the right pace. As you progress towards your goals, your trainer will work with you to make the right adjustments in your workout routine so that you area maximizing your efforts when appropriate.`,

  {
    title: 'Nutrition',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `When completing their Certificate III in Fitness, every student is required to complete a module on nutrition and how it can affect fitness. Personal Trainers who complete their Certificate IV in Fitness have to then complete additional work on nutrition, and a number of Personal Trainers also add on additional education to their program by completing a Nutrition course such as those offered by the Australian Institute of Fitness.

  By choosing a Personal Trainer who has undergone specific nutrition education, you know that they will be providing the right nutritional advice to achieve your goals.`,

    title: 'Balance',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `It has long been known that physical exercise can help with mental health issues such as depression, and that it is a recommended part of treatment by many medical health professionals. Having a Personal Trainer to help with your exercise plan when you suffer from mental health problems can help with motivation, with choosing the right exercises to release the most endorphins, and also just to have another shoulder to lean on.`,

  {
    title: 'Holistic',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `Let’s be honest, most of the time when exercising with your Personal Trainer you will be telling them about your week, how work is going, and what’s wrong with your life at the time. This is normal!

  A Personal Trainer is there to help with your fitness goals, yes, but they’re also there to help improve your overall wellbeing. They care about how stressed you are, because that will impact how motivated you are in your sessions. They care if you’re unhappy in a relationship, as this could result in eating unhealthily.

  There are myriad ways in which having a Personal Trainer can be like having an unofficial therapist.`,

  {
    title: 'Positive Habits',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `It can take weeks to form good habits, and even longer to break bad ones - and trying to do it on your own is hard work. Having a Personal Trainer is like having a good angel on your shoulder encouraging you in the right direction. They can help to argue with the bad angel in your head, and keep you on track to achieve your fitness goals.`,

    title: 'Scheduling Flexibility',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `Regardless of whether the only time you have available to train is at a ridiculously early hour before work, or on your lunch break, or mid-afternoon before the kids come home from school - a Personal Trainer is one of the most versatile professions in terms of hours. They understand that different people have different availabilities, and so they will tailor appointment times to suit you.`,

    title: 'Range of Motion Flexibility',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `Not everyone enjoys the atmosphere of a crowded gym, or having to wait for the machine you want to use to become available. The benefit of having a Personal Trainer is that you aren’t limited to working out where equipment is available - not only will your PT have some equipment that they can bring with them, but you can also choose the location in which you exercise.

  Whether it’s in the comfort of your own home or in your neighbourhood park, with a Personal Trainer you have the flexibility to workout wherever suits you best.`,

    title: 'Motivation',
    image: '../../assets/images/bw-girl-pushups.jpg',
    content: `Are you getting bored with your fitness routine? Have you progressed beyond the exercises you know and have plateaued in your fitness? A Personal Trainer is what you need to take you to the next level, and continuously challenge your abilities.

  Don’t think you can lift that medicine ball?

  Positive you won’t fit back into your favourite dress?

  Doubt you’ll be able to compete in a charity run next year?

  A Personal Trainer is your life coach, nutrition guide and encourager all in one, and without them your fitness goals are that much harder to achieve. So what are you waiting for? Find a professional Personal Trainer today to help achieve your fitness goals.`,
