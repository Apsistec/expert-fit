### [[About The Project](#acknowledgements)](https://github.com/apsistec/expert-fit/issues)

[[[![product-screenshot]](http://expert-fitness-midland-tx.web.app "Expert Fitness
Landing Page")
There are many great fitness apps available on GitHub.
However, I didn&#39;t find one that really suit my client&#39;s needs.
So I created this enhanced one.
I want to create a fitness app so amazing that it&#39;ll be the last one my client
ever needs.
I think this is it.](#acknowledgements)](https://github.com/apsistec/expert-fit/issues)

* [[Time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a

* [[Clients shouldn&#39;t be using a plain website now that progressive web apps have
  entered the market](#acknowledgements)](https://github.com/apsistec/expert-fit/issues)
* [[We should implement DRY coding principles to the app code :barbell:](#acknowledgements)](https://github.com/apsistec/expert-fit/issues)

project any updates and additional features that are relevant to the industry
