<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![product-screenshot]](http://expert-fitness-midland-tx.web.app "Expert Fitness
Landing Page")
There are many great fitness apps available on GitHub.
However, I didn't find one that really suit my client's needs.
So I created this enhanced one.
I want to create a fitness app so amazing that it'll be the last one my client
ever needs.
I think this is it.

Here's why:

* Time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a
  problem and helps others
* Clients shouldn't be using a plain website now that progressive web apps have
  entered the market
* We should implement DRY coding principles to the app code :barbell:

Of course, this is a continued work in progress. I will constantly add to this
project any updates and additional features that are relevant to the industry
and/or to progressive web apps in general.

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or
opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding
this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
