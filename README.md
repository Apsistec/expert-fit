<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![product-screenshot][product screenshot]][screenshot]

The goal has been simple, to develop a fitness app capable of guiding users
effeciently to help them reach their peak fitness goals and then help
them maintain. THe app needs to be easy to access, easy to use, and is an
interesting tool that is rewarding to use. The app is a tool in the
toolbox capable of providing users with realtime reports and has
numerous novel views about their current progress and how it relates to
others. The app provides access to dashboards and reports from
personally attained data on the user's own smart devices and comparing
that to available fitness related datasets. The app provides access to
the latest proven and well documented information on techniques and
diets that are safe and effective. The app also providees access to many
of the latest safe and effective fitness products available in the
market. Using the app is rewarding and more effective at helping users
reach their personal goals and then maintaining them.

Here's why:

- Time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a
  problem and helps others
- Clients shouldn't be using a plain website now that progressive web apps have
  entered the market
- We should implement DRY coding principles to the app code

Of course, this is a continued work in progress. I will constantly add to this
project any updates and additional features that are relevant to the industry
and/or to progressive web apps in general. You may also suggest changes by
forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding
this template!
