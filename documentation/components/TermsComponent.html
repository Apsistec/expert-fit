    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product
      or service availability, errors in the description or price of the product or service, error in your order or
      other reasons.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;

    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through Service may be
      governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please
      review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion conflict with these Terms
      of Service, Promotion rules will apply.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;5. &lt;b&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a
      recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription
      plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
      unless you cancel it or Xpert Fitness cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
      online account management page or by contacting
      &lt;a
        target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;
        rel&#x3D;&quot;nofollow&quot;
        href&#x3D;&quot;mailto:support@xfitness.studio?subject&#x3D;Cancel%20Subscription&amp;body&#x3D;Cancel%20Subscription%20Details%3A&quot;
        &gt;support@xfitness.studio&lt;/a
      &gt;
      customer support team.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide X Fitness
      Studio with accurate and complete billing information that may include but not limited to full name, address,
      state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
      information, you automatically authorize Xpert Fitness to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your
      account to any such payment instruments.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Xpert Fitness reserves the right to terminate your
      access to the Service with immediate effect.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;6. &lt;b&gt;Free Trial&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Xpert Fitness may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time
      (&quot;Free Trial&quot;).
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;
      &gt;You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for Free Trial.&lt;/ion-text
    &gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you will not be charged by X Fitness
      Studio until Free Trial has expired. On the last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription,
      you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      At any time and without notice, Xpert Fitness reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial
      offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;7. &lt;b&gt;Fee Changes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Xpert Fitness, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any
      Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Xpert Fitness will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an
      opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay
      the modified Subscription fee amount.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;8. &lt;b&gt;Refunds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;
      &gt;We issue refunds for Contracts within &lt;b&gt;30 days&lt;/b&gt; of the original purchase of the Contract.&lt;/ion-text

      EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS HARMLESS FOR ANY
      INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND
      ALL RELATED COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LITIGATION AND ARBITRATION, OR AT TRIAL OR ON APPEAL, IF ANY, WHETHER OR NOT
      LITIGATION OR ARBITRATION IS INSTITUTED), WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION,
      OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY CLAIM FOR PERSONAL INJURY
      OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY VIOLATION BY YOU OF ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL LAWS,
      STATUTES, RULES, OR REGULATIONS, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
      EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF THERE IS LIABILITY FOUND ON THE PART OF COMPANY, IT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT
      PAID FOR THE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES, AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THERE BE CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
      SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE
      PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;21. &lt;b&gt;Termination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or liability,
      under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach
      of Terms.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using Service.&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including,
      without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;22. &lt;b&gt;Governing Law&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of US Texas, which governing law applies
      to agreement without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If
      any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these
      Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and
      supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;23. &lt;b&gt;Changes To Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via Service, in our
      sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Service is unavailable
      at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire
      Service, to users, including registered users.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;24. &lt;b&gt;Amendments To Terms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to review
      these Terms periodically.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the
      changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on
      you.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the
      revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;25. &lt;b&gt;Waiver And Severability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
      such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right or
      provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;
      If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
      unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the
      remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
    &lt;/ion-text&gt;
    &lt;ion-text color&#x3D;&quot;light&quot;&gt;26. &lt;b&gt;Acknowledgement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ion-text&gt;
