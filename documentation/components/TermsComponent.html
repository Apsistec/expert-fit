    description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other
    reasons.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an
    unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”)
    made available through Service may be governed by rules that are separate
    from these Terms of Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please
    review the applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for
    a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion rules will
    apply.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;5. &lt;b&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
    (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
    periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles will be set depending on
    the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew
    under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Expert Fitness
    cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
    online account management page or by contacting
    &lt;a
      target&#x3D;&quot;_blank&quot;
      rel&#x3D;&quot;nofollow&quot;
      href&#x3D;&quot;mailto:support@expert-fitness.com?subject&#x3D;Cancel%20Subscription&amp;body&#x3D;Cancel%20Subscription%20Details%3A&quot;
      &gt;support@expert-fitness.com&lt;/a
    &gt;
    customer support team.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    A valid payment method is required to process the payment for your
    subscription. You shall provide Expert Fitness with accurate and complete
    billing information that may include but not limited to full name,
    address, state, postal or zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment
    method information. By submitting such payment information, you
    automatically authorize Expert Fitness to charge all Subscription fees
    incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Expert Fitness
    reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service with immediate
    effect.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;6. &lt;b&gt;Free Trial&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Expert Fitness may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
    trial for a limited period of time (&quot;Free Trial&quot;).
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up
    for Free Trial.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you
    will not be charged by Expert Fitness until Free Trial has expired. On the
    last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you
    will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type
    of Subscription you have selected.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    At any time and without notice, Expert Fitness reserves the right to (i)
    modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial
    offer.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;7. &lt;b&gt;Fee Changes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Expert Fitness, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
    Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will
    become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Expert Fitness will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change
    in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
    Subscription before such change becomes effective.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into
    effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
    amount.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;8. &lt;b&gt;Refunds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We issue refunds for Contracts within &lt;b&gt;30 days&lt;/b&gt; of the original
    purchase of the Contract.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;20. &lt;b&gt;Limitation Of Liability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU WILL HOLD US AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
    EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS HARMLESS FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, HOWEVER IT ARISES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’

    DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;21. &lt;b&gt;Termination&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service
    immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion,
    for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited
    to a breach of Terms.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using
    Service.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    All provisions of Terms which by their nature should survive termination
    shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
    provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;22. &lt;b&gt;Governing Law&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
    US Texas, which governing law applies to agreement without regard to its
    conflict of law provisions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be
    considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held
    to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these
    Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
    between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior
    agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;23. &lt;b&gt;Changes To Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or
    material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We
    will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Service is
    unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may
    restrict access to some parts of Service, or the entire Service, to users,
    including registered users.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;24. &lt;b&gt;Amendments To Terms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    We may amend Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It
    is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms
    means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check
    this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on
    you.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become
    effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree
    to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;25. &lt;b&gt;Waiver And Severability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be
    deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver
    of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to assert a right
    or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
    provision.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent
    jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such
    provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the
    remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;26. &lt;b&gt;Acknowledgement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
