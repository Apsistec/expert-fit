<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![product-screenshot][product screenshot]][screenshot]

There are many great fitness apps available on GitHub.
However, I didn't find one that really suit my client's needs.
So I created this enhanced one.
I want to create a fitness app so amazing that it'll be the last one my client
ever needs.
I think this is it.

Here's why:

- Time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a
  problem and helps others
- Clients shouldn't be using a plain website now that progressive web apps have
  entered the market
- We should implement DRY coding principles to the app code :barbell:

Of course, this is a continued work in progress. I will constantly add to this
project any updates and additional features that are relevant to the industry
and/or to progressive web apps in general.

You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or
opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding
this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### [[About The Project](#acknowledgements)](https://github.com/apsistec/expert-fit/issues)

[[[![product-screenshot]](http://expert-fitness-midland-tx.web.app "Expert Fitness
Landing Page")

There are many great fitness apps available on GitHub. However, I could not find an app that truly embraced the reporting features capable with javascript libraries.
The goal has been simple, to develop a fitness app capable of guiding users effeciently to help them reach their peak fitness goals and then help them maintain. THe app needs to be easy to access, easy to use, and is an interesting tool that is rewarding to use. The app is a tool in the toolbox capable of providing users with realtime reports and has numerous novel views about their current progress and how it relates to others. The app provides access to dashboards and reports from personally attained data on the user's own smart devices and comparing that to available fitness related datasets. The app provides access to the latest proven and well documented information on techniques and diets that are safe and effective. The app also providees access to many of the latest safe and effective fitness products available in the market. Using the app is rewarding and more effective at helping users reach their personal goals and then maintaining them.
